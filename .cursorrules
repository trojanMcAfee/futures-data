Python: 
- Before running any command, make sure to activate the virtual environment, which lives in the venv/ directory.
- Once you've activated the virtual environment, you can run commands using `python <command>` instead of `python3 <command>`.

Keep secrets, like API keys, in the .env file located in the root directory.
