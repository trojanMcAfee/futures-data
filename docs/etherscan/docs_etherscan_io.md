As a means to provide equitable access to blockchain data, we've developed the **Etherscan Developer APIs** to empower developers with direct access to Etherscan's block explorer data and services via **GET/POST requests.**

Etherscan's APIs are provided as a **community service** and **without warranty**, so please use what you need and no more.

> Your app may need to show _a user's ERC-20 token holdings_ and their USD value 💰 , check if a transaction has been mined ⛏️ or _get the latest gas price estimates_ ⛽ _._

For that you may find a suitable endpoint from our wide range of APIs that you can simply query to provide data while you remain fully focused on building your applications.

Etherscan offers 2 types of API plans, a set of free **community endpoints** and [**API PRO**](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-pro/etherscan-api-pro) which consists of additional derived blockchain data.

**Note :** All Free API endpoint returns a maximum of **1000 records/call** only.
