Endpoint used: " [**Get a list of 'ERC20 - Token Transfer Events' by Address**](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts#get-a-list-of-erc20-token-transfer-events-by-address)"

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/recipes/get-all-usdt-transfers-from-binance\#id-1.-determine-the-contract-address-of-the-usdt-token)    1\. Determine the contract address of the USDT token

Simply by going on [**Etherscan**](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) and searching for "USDT", we're able to determine it as `0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7` which we'll set as the `contractaddress` parameter.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/recipes/get-all-usdt-transfers-from-binance\#id-2.-filter-by-a-specific-address-to-watch-for)    2\. Filter by a specific address to watch for

In this case, we're looking to observe one of [**Binance's hot wallets**](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfd5293d8e347dfe59e90efd55b2956a1343963d), also tagged and available on Etherscan.

We'll set the `address` parameter to `0xdfd5293d8e347dfe59e90efd55b2956a1343963d` , which indicates that we'll filter token transfers by this address.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/recipes/get-all-usdt-transfers-from-binance\#id-3.-sort-by-the-latest-token-transfers-first)    3\. Sort by the latest token transfers first

As a preference, we'll set the `sort` parameter to `desc` to get the latest transactions first, though you can always get the oldest first by flipping it to `asc`.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/recipes/get-all-usdt-transfers-from-binance\#id-4.-integrate-and-format-token-decimals)    4\. Integrate and format token decimals

One thing to note is the token `value` field is returned in the token's smallest representation, you would have to divide this by the token `decimal` to get the transfer amount.

An example value of `198000000000` would be represented as the transfer of `198000` USDT.
