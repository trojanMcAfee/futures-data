### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/v2-faq\#tl-dr-what-are-the-breaking-changes)    TL;DR what are the breaking changes ?

There are no breaking changes. All updates are backward-compatible, but we recommend switching to V2 sooner rather than later for easier multichain app development.

Please note that we do plan to deprecate V1 over time.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/v2-faq\#how-many-chains-can-i-batch-together)    How many chains can I batch together ?

Our endpoint accepts one \`chainId\` at a time, feel free to repeat the query for each chain you need to access.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/v2-faq\#is-there-an-end-of-support-deadline-to-make-changes)    Is there an end of support/deadline to make changes ?

We don't have any timeline to deprecate anything yet.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/v2-faq\#how-do-i-reference-the-older-v1-docs)    How do I reference the older V1 docs ?

Its still [**here**](https://docs.etherscan.io/).

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/v2-faq\#how-are-rate-limits-calculated)    How are rate limits calculated ?

Exactly as before—based on [**your plan**](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/support/rate-limits), with a per-second request limit and an overall daily limit.

To manage this, you can set up [**programmatic alerts**](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/api-endpoints/blocks-1) or enable overage charges if needed for peace of mind.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.etherscan.io/etherscan-v2/v2-faq\#does-this-cover-contract-verification)    Does this cover contract verification ?

Soon! We're collaborating with the Hardhat and Foundry teams to streamline this process—goodbye to managing 20 different API keys.
